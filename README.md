# WingMan BD

WingMan BD is a blood donation app designed to connect blood donors, recipients, hospitals, and organizations in a seamless and efficient manner. The app aims to address the challenges faced by the blood donation community, such as finding compatible donors, ensuring safe and timely delivery, and avoiding wastage and shortages.

## Features

- **Donor Connectivity:** WingMan BD provides a platform for blood and platelet donors to register their blood type, location, availability, and preferences. Donors can conveniently donate blood or platelets and track their donations, receive feedback, and earn rewards.

- **Recipient Support:** Recipients and hospitals can request blood or platelets from nearby donors who match their criteria. The app facilitates real-time notifications, map-based navigation to donation points, and easy communication channels between recipients and donors.

- **Hospital Integration:** Hospitals can reduce the costs and risks associated with blood or platelet procurement by monitoring the supply and demand of blood products and optimizing their inventory. They can also access insights and analytics on donation histories and manage blood camps efficiently.

- **Organization Collaboration:** Organizations can promote their causes, recruit more donors, and organize events through the app. They can access data and analytics to measure their impact, improve performance, and engage in solo/group communications within their respective groups.
